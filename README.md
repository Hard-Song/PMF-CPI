# PMF-CPIï¼šAssessing drug selectivity with a pretrained multi-functional model for compound-protein interactions
sequence-based compound protein interaction prediction
## Abstract
Here we present a pretrained multi-functional model for compound-protein interaction prediction (PMF-CPI) and fine-tune it to assess drug selectivity.  PMF-CPI can accurately predict different drug affinities or opposite interactions toward similar targets, recognizing selective drugs for precise therapeutics.
